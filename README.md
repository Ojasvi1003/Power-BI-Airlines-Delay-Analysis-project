# ✈️ Airlines Delay Analysis - Power BI Project
This project presents an in-depth analysis of airline delay patterns using Microsoft Power BI. It involves cleaning and transforming raw flight data, modeling relationships between key entities, and building interactive, insightful dashboards to understand delay trends, root causes, and operational performance.

🔍 Key Highlights:
Utilized Power Query for efficient data cleaning, merging, and transformation.

Built a star schema data model to optimize performance and enable accurate reporting.

Developed custom DAX measures for KPIs like average delay time, % of delayed flights, and total cancellations.

Designed interactive dashboards featuring slicers, bar charts, line graphs, and maps to visualize delay distribution across routes, airlines, and time.

Enabled users to drill down by airport, airline, date, and cause of delay for targeted insights.
